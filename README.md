## About Revisio
This app is not like a typical text editor. It is for revisions of raw written material for articles, essays, and even chapters or sections of text. Its purpose is to automate the boring copying and pasting of sentences that you do in a typical text editor to sort them in the text. The app also allows you to rewrite each sentence and keeps a history of different versions of the sentences so you can choose the best ones. 

## How it works
- The app splits the text into sentences that you can easily sort to achieve a nice flow for reading. 
- You can write new versions of every sentence and compare it with the original sentence. 
- The app joins the sentences in paragraphs for your convenience to read the revised text.

## Instructions
1. Copy the raw text into the right panel and click the **Tokenize** button. The text is then split into sentences.
2. Use the mouse or **Up** and **Down Arrow** keys to select a sentence in the left panel.
3. Use drag and drop or **Alt+Up** or **Alt+Down** to sort the sentences.
4. To insert a new sentence below the current one hit **Alt+Enter**. 
5. To write a new version of a sentence press **Enter** to go into *sentence editing mode*. If there is only one version of the sentence you will be prompted to write a new version. If there are already two versions of the sentence you can select the better one with the **Enter** key. To edit a sentence version without writing a new version double click with the mouse on it. Press the **Esc** key to exit *sentence editing mode* and show only the better version of the sentence. 
6. To join the sentences back into paragraphs press the **Preview** button. 
7. If you are happy with the revision press the **Copy** button to copy the revised text and put it into your working document.
