## About Revisio
Revisio is a web app for text revisions, but not like a typical text editor. Its purpose is to help you focus on creation rather than manipulation. It gives you a bird's eye view of your text so you can easily achieve good writing flow. It aids you in your change choices. And allows you to copy the revised text back to your main text editing program. 

The app is useful for sorting out the flow of the text by easily changing sentence positions. It helps you decide if your changes are better and worth keeping by keeping a history of them. The editing is done swiftly with keyboard shortcuts. The boring sorting manipulations of the text are automated. And the data is saved automatically in the cache of your browser.
