## About Revisio
This app is not like a typical text editor. It is for revisions of raw written material for articles, essays, and even chapters or sections of text. Its purpose is to automate the boring copying and pasting of sentences that you do in a typical text editor to sort them in the text. The app also allows you to rewrite each sentence and keeps a history of different versions of the sentences, so you can choose the best ones. 

## How it works
- The app splits the text into sentences that you can easily sort to achieve a nice flow for reading. 
- You can write new versions of every sentence and compare it with the original sentence to choose the better one. 
- The app joins the sentences in paragraphs for your convenience to read the revised text.
- The app automatically saves your revision in the Local Storage of your browser.
